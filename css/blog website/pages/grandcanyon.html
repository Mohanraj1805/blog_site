            <p>The Grand Canyon is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World and is located in the northern part of Arizona. Known for its breathtaking vistas and geological significance, the Grand Canyon attracts millions of visitors each year. Whether you’re hiking the canyon's trails, rafting the Colorado River, or simply taking in the scenic views from the various lookout points, the Grand Canyon offers an unforgettable experience. The area around the Grand Canyon is rustic, with limited access to modern amenities, but it is rich in natural beauty.</p> <p><strong>Budget Hotel Prices</strong> – Budget accommodations near the Grand Canyon typically start at $80-120 per night. These can be basic motels or lodges that offer amenities like private bathrooms, free WiFi, and air-conditioning. Alternatively, campgrounds around the Grand Canyon are also a popular and cheaper option, with fees starting around $20-30 per night for tent camping.</p> <p><strong>Average Cost of Food</strong> – Food at the Grand Canyon can be a bit more expensive due to its remote location.

If you plan on cooking, groceries for a week can cost around $50-70, which can include basics like pasta, vegetables, and snacks for your trip.</p> <p><strong>Transportation Costs</strong> – The Grand Canyon is a popular tourist destination, but it is located in a relatively remote area.
